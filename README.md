# Modal Popup Project

This project demonstrates a simple modal popup functionality with a clean and responsive design. It includes multiple modal buttons that open a modal window, which can be closed using the close button, the overlay, or the Escape key.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The modal and overlay adjust gracefully to different screen sizes.
- **Keyboard Interaction:** Users can close the modal using the `Escape` key.
- **Dynamic Buttons:** Multiple buttons trigger the same modal functionality.
- **Smooth UX:** Includes animations for modal opening and closing.

## Files Overview

### 1. `index.html`
- Contains the structure of the webpage.
- Includes three buttons to trigger the modal.
- Defines the modal content and overlay.

### 2. `style.css`
- Provides styling for the modal, overlay, and buttons.
- Includes responsive layout and hover effects.
- Ensures a visually appealing gradient background.

### 3. `script.js`
- Adds interactivity to the modal buttons, close button, overlay, and `Escape` key.
- Implements functionality to toggle modal visibility dynamically.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click on any of the "Show modal" buttons to display the modal window.
3. Close the modal by:
   - Clicking the close button (`Ã—`).
   - Clicking outside the modal (on the overlay).
   - Pressing the `Escape` key on the keyboard.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure all three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3:** For styling and animations.
